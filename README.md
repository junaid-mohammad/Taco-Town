# Taco Town üåÆ

This repository contains the source code for **Taco Town**, a playful and interactive recipe app that helps users select their favorite taco and view its detailed ingredients. The project is built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **EJS templating**, with a focus on dynamic content rendering, JSON data handling, and modern responsive web design.

## üéØ Purpose

**Taco Town** was created as part of my journey to strengthen my web development skills while also learning how to:

- Work with **private APIs and JSON data structures**.
- Parse and stringify JSON using `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()`.
- Handle dynamic routing and user input using **Express**.
- Dynamically render HTML content using **EJS** templating.
- Improve **frontend design** with responsive layouts and modern CSS techniques.
- Deploy a Node.js app using **Microsoft Azure**.

This project serves both as a creative exercise in designing a fun, user-friendly food app and as a technical learning experience in both frontend and backend web development concepts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Home Page with Emoji Buttons**: Users can choose between chicken, beef, or fish tacos by clicking playful emoji buttons.
- **Dynamic Recipe Rendering**: Based on the user‚Äôs selection, the app dynamically retrieves the taco recipe data from a **private JSON API** and renders it using **EJS**.
- **JSON Data Parsing**: Recipes are stored in JSON format and parsed into JavaScript objects for dynamic use.
- **Clean, Responsive Design**: The app features a custom patterned background, centered content, and responsive layout that adapts gracefully to both desktop and mobile screens.
- **Navigation Bar**: Includes a home button to allow users to reset their selection.
- **Footer with Dynamic Year**: A personalized footer that automatically updates the copyright year.

## üß© What I Learned

- **Working with JSON APIs**: Created a private JSON-based recipe dataset and learned how to access and manipulate the data within the app.
- **JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify()**: Practiced converting JSON data to JavaScript objects and vice versa.
- **Dynamic Content Rendering with EJS**: Learned to pass server-side data into EJS templates for user-friendly, dynamic webpage updates.
- **Routing and Form Handling with Express**: Built GET and POST routes to handle user input and display results.
- **Responsive Design Principles**: Created a clean, mobile-friendly layout using modern CSS techniques including flexbox, media queries, and responsive units.
- **Azure Deployment Workflow**: Understood the steps for deploying an app to **Microsoft Azure App Service**, including linking GitHub for CI/CD.

## üöÄ Deployment on Azure

The Taco Town app is automatically deployed on **Microsoft Azure App Service** using **Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** from GitHub.

### üõ† Deployment Workflow:

1. **App Service Creation**: Set up a new App Service on Azure.
2. **Connected to GitHub**:
   - Linked the App Service to the Taco Town GitHub repository through Azure's Deployment Center.
   - Configured the main branch (`main`) for automatic deployment.
3. **Push to Deploy**:
   - Whenever new code is pushed to the `main` branch, Azure automatically:
     - Pulls the latest commit.
     - Rebuilds the app.
     - Deploys the updated version to the live website.

This workflow ensures that updates are immediately reflected on the live site without any manual intervention.
